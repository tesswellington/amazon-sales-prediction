# Amazon Sales Prediction
Predicting Amazon customer order totals based on state and date using machine learning. This project was part of a course competition at UCLA, where we built predictive models to estimate 'log_total', a log-transformed version of the total order value for different states and months.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Dataset provided by the professor for a course competition (originally from a survey of around 5000 Amazon customers, 2018-2022)
- **Features Include:** Order count, household size, customer age groups, household income, education level, number of members in household
- **Target Variable:** 'log_total' (log-transformed order value)

## Machine Learning Models
- **Baseline:**  Linear Regression
- **ML Models Tested:** Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosted Tree, KNN, GLM
- **Final Model:** Stacked Ensemble Model (lowest RMSE)
